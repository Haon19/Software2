"""Implement the following class hierarchy using Python: A publication can be either a book or a magazine. Each
publication has a name. Each book also has an author and a page count, whereas each magazine has a chief editor. Also
write the required initializers to both classes. Create a print_information method to both subclasses for printing out
all information of the publication in question. In the main program, create publications Donald Duck
(chief editor Aki Hyypp√§) and Compartment No. 6 (author Rosa Liksom, 192 pages). Print out all information of both
publications using the methods you implemented."""
